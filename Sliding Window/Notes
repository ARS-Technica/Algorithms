Prerequisite to use Sliding window technique

The use of Sliding Window technique can be done in a very specific scenario, 
where the size of window for computation is fixed throughout the complete nested
loop. Only then the time complexity can be reduced. 

How to use Sliding Window Technique?

The general use of Sliding window technique can be demonstrated as following:

Find the size of window required 

Compute the result for 1st window, i.e. from start of data structure
Then use a loop to slide the window by 1, and keep computing the result window by window.
