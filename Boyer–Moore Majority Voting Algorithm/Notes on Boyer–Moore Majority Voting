# Pseudocode:

# Initialize an element majority and a counter i = 0
# votes = list of integer votes


majority = None
majority_count = 0

for vote in votes:
    if majority_count == 0:
        majority = vote
    if vote == majority:
        majority_count += 1
    else:
        majority_count -= 1

return majority


! Boyer–Moore majority vote algorithm produces correct results only when the majority element is present in the input.


1. Begin by initializing two variables, num and a counter count, both of which are set to 0.
2. Now we’ll begin iterating over the number and for each element x.
3. We first check to see if the count is 0, and then we assign num to x.
4. Then we check to see if the current num is equal to x, if not, we decrease the count by one, else we increment it by one.
5. Reset the counter to zero.
6. Find the frequency of the num variable by looping through the nums array.
7. Now, if the count is larger than N/2, we return num; otherwise we return -1.


Loop through each element of the array, and maintain two integers candidate i.e., the potential candidate to be the majority element and count.

At a given index i:
  - If arr[i] is equal to the candidate, then, increment count by 1.
  - If arr[i] is not equal to the candidate, then, decrement count by 1.
  - If the count becomes zero, then, the value at that index will be the new value of candidate and count will be set to 1.
  
At the end, the value stored in candidate will be the majority element of the array, if exists.
As a final check, iterate through the array and check if the frequency of the candidate in the array is greater than n/2 or not. If yes, then that is the majority element. Otherwise, we can say that the array doesn’t have a majority element.
